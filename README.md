# Over-Bingo

![Over-Bingo Game](src/cover.png)

**A chaotic fusion of bingo, math, and frantic multiplayer action.**

Inspired by the cooperative chaos of _Overcooked_, Over-Bingo challenges players to work together (or against each other) to complete a bingo board. It's not about luck; it's about quick thinking, frantic coordination, and a bit of mathematical mayhem.

## 1\. Game Concept

Players control characters on a giant 5x5 bingo board that is pre-filled with random numbers. Most numbers are initially hidden, with only 1-2 smallest numbers visible at the start. Players must collect or create numbers using raw numbers and processing stations, then place them on matching revealed cells to claim them. Successfully claiming a cell reveals 1-5 random unrevealed cells (count increases with game progress), creating unpredictable discovery patterns. The first player or team to achieve a "BINGO" (5 in a row, column, or diagonal) wins. The challenge comes from adapting to random reveals while competing with other players for board control.

## 2\. Core Gameplay Loop

The game operates in a strategic, discovery-based loop:

1.  **Survey Revealed Numbers:** Players examine the board to see which numbers are currently visible (initially just 1-2 smallest numbers).
2.  **Choose Target:** Players strategically select a revealed number to target, considering bingo potential and expansion opportunities.
3.  **Gather Ingredients:** Players run to "Number Stations" located around the board to pick up raw, single-digit numbers (e.g., '6', '7').
4.  **Process the Numbers:** Players take their gathered numbers to "Processing Stations" (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to combine them.
    - _Example:_ To create `42`, a player might pick up a `6` and a `7`, take them to a Multiplication (`*`) station, and combine them to produce a `42`.
5.  **Claim the Cell:** The player carries the finished number (`42`) to the matching revealed cell and places it there, claiming that cell for their team.
6.  **Reveal Random Cells:** Successfully claiming a cell reveals 1-5 random unrevealed cells (count increases progressively), exposing new numbers and opportunities.
7.  **Repeat:** Players continue discovering new areas and targeting strategically important numbers until someone achieves a bingo.

## 3\. Key Mechanics

### 3.1 The Bingo Board: The World

- The primary game area is a 5x5 grid where players move freely.
- Each square is pre-filled with a random number (1-100) at the start of the game.
- Most squares are initially hidden (showing "?"), with only 1-2 smallest numbers visible.
- The central square is a traditional "Free Space," automatically claimed for all players.
- Hidden squares show "?", revealed squares show their numbers, and claimed squares are highlighted in the player's color.

### 3.2 Progressive Reveal System

- Players can only target revealed numbers on the board - hidden cells cannot be claimed.
- Numbers range from 1-100, providing variety in mathematical challenges.
- Players must create the exact number shown on a revealed cell to claim it.
- Successfully claiming a cell reveals 1-5 random unrevealed cells (count increases with game progress), creating unpredictable discovery patterns.
- Strategic players adapt to random reveals while planning optimal claim sequences to uncover bingo opportunities.

### 3.3 Number Stations & Processing

- **Number Stations:** These are dispensers for "raw" numbers, likely single digits (e.g., 0-9). Players can grab one number at a time. These stations have an infinite supply or respawn numbers quickly.
- **Processing Stations:** These are tables or machines dedicated to one of four operations: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
  - A player must bring two numbers to a station to perform an operation.
  - _Example Workflow:_ Player 1 picks up '8'. Player 2 picks up '5'. Player 1 places '8' on the `+` table. Player 2 adds their '5' to it, which consumes both numbers and produces a '13' for Player 2 to carry.
- **Workbenches:** To facilitate complex operations and stealing, there can be neutral "workbench" surfaces. Players can leave a raw or processed number on a workbench temporarily. **Crucially, any number left on a workbench can be stolen by another player.**

### 3.4 Multiplayer Interactions

- **Stealing:** Players can steal numbers left on workbenches, but not directly from another player's hands. This creates a risk/reward for preparing numbers in advance.
- **Shared Board Squares:** A single square on the bingo board cannot be claimed by everyone. See the proposal below for handling this.

## 4\. Game Modes

The game is designed with multiple modes in mind, starting with the simplest.

- **Single Player:** A frantic puzzle and time-attack mode. The player must complete the bingo board before a timer runs out. The challenge is in optimizing the path and calculations.
- **Multiplayer - Cooperative (Co-op):**
  - All players work together to fill a single bingo board as fast as possible.
  - Players must coordinate who is grabbing which numbers and performing which calculations. Communication is key.
  - Can be played locally (shared screen with keyboard + gamepads) or online.
- **Multiplayer - Versus (VS):**
  - Each player or team (e.g., 2v2) gets their own bingo board.
  - Players compete to be the first to get a BINGO.
  - All players share the same pool of Number Stations and Processing Stations, leading to direct competition for resources and opportunities for sabotage (e.g., stealing a crucial number from an opponent's workbench).
  - Can be played locally (split-screen) or online.

## 5\. Open Design Questions & Proposals

This section is for clarifying design choices that need to be made.

### 5.1 Progressive Reveal Balance

- **Question:** How many cells should be revealed initially and after each claim?
- **Current Implementation:** 1 cell revealed in single-player, 2 cells in multiplayer (smallest numbers). Each successful claim reveals 1-5 random cells (starts at 1, increases by 1 every 3 claims, max 5).
- **Design Rationale:** This creates unpredictable discovery patterns that require players to adapt their strategies while maintaining manageable complexity.

### 5.2 Bingo Square Occupancy Limit

- **Question:** How many players can use the same square for their bingo line?
- **Proposal:** A square can be marked by a maximum of $\\lfloor N / 2 \\rfloor$ players (or teams), where $N$ is the total number of players in the game. In cases where this is zero, the limit is 1.
  - **2 Players/Teams:** Only 1 player can mark a given square.
  - **3 Players/Teams:** Only 1 player can mark a given square ($\\lfloor 3 / 2 \\rfloor = 1$).
  - **4 Players/Teams:** Up to 2 players can mark the same square ($\\lfloor 4 / 2 \\rfloor = 2$).
  - This prevents every player from using the exact same 5 squares and forces board diversity.

## 6. Proposed Tech Stack

This project will be built using modern web technologies to ensure it's accessible directly through a browser without any downloads.

- **Frontend Framework / Engine:** **Phaser 3** or **PixiJS**.
  - **Phaser** is a robust 2D game framework with built-in physics, input management, and scene handling, making it ideal for a project of this scope.
- **Language:** **TypeScript**.
  - We'll use TypeScript for type safety, which helps prevent common bugs and makes the codebase easier for a team to manage.
- **Backend Server:** **Node.js** with **Express.js**.
  - A standard, high-performance choice for handling game logic, and matchmaking.
- **Real-time Communication (Multiplayer):** **Socket.IO** or **Colyseus**.
  - **Socket.IO** is a reliable library for WebSocket communication, perfect for sending real-time game state updates between clients and the server.
  - **Colyseus** is a more specialized, state-syncing multiplayer framework for Node.js that could significantly accelerate development.
- **Build Tool / Bundler:** **Vite**.
  - Vite will provide a fast development server and efficient bundling for the final production build.
- **Version Control:** **Git**.
